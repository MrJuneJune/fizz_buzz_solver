# FizzBuzz Solvers

## Motivation

FizzBuzz is a common problem in programming interviews. I decided to create a neural network (NN) that solves FizzBuzz using Python for fun. This way, if someone asks me this question, I can demonstrate a solution using a neural network and say, "I don't know how it works" humorously.

I also plan to add a graphical implementation to show how these NNs work, which will be an interesting challenge. My goal is to visualize this on the web, either by replicating the whole thing in JavaScript or by using a Python API to show updates.

## Prerequisites

Set up any Python environment. I usually create a Docker image or a Python virtual environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

Run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py # or any equivalent command
```

## Explanations

Further explanations and details about the project will be provided here.
