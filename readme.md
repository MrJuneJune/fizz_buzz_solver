# FizzBuzz solvers

# Motivation

Fizz buzz is a common problem asked in programming. I want to just create a NN that solves FizzBuzz using python for fun so when evidently some dude ask me this question, I solve using NN and say hey I don't know how it works hehe.

I will also add a graphic implementation on how these NN works which would be fun (cancer to do)

## Pre-requisite

Start any python env. I would usually create docker image or python virtual env.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run

Run the main.py

```
python main.py # or any equivalents
```

## Explanations
